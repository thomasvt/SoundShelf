A very simple sound effect library browser. Made for my gamedev work.

* Scans one or more folders for .wav files
* Can search your library by name and tags deduced from filename and wav metadata.
* Plays sound upon selection
* Visualizes wave, lets you select a slice with the mouse
* Extracts slice to new .wav file
